# VinylVirtuoso  
A news site for artists and musicians, to publish news and updates regarding their work.

This allows artists (such as you!) to submit news they wanted to be published through possible means (i.e. email),  
and our admins will process it for you.

## Features
 * News, personalized as a blog-esque style entry with headlines, description, and images. The usual stuff!
 * A personalized page for each artist, easy for listeners or fans to browse all news regarding them.
 * Links provided to each news, whether it's a release announcement or things that are relevant to said news.
 * Search functions for proper filtering, whether by news keywords or artist.

## Tech Stack
 This project is made possible by technologies such as Laravel and Bootstrap.
